Look around you
Look beyond
You could make an unbreakable bond
The world around is not what it seems
Souls revealed beyond your wildest dream

So many things I never could see
So many choices falling on me
Could it be my destiny
To be shaman
Shaman king
To be shaman
Shaman king
If you're spirit is strong
You could be the one

I can look at the world
In a different light
I know what it takes
To make it right
And I won't give up the fight
To be shaman
Shaman King
